            <h3>The Goal of the Research</h3>
            <p>
              This research aims to develop a genetic prediction model for T1D
              by analyzing genetic markers. This model seeks to enhance the
              accuracy of T1D diagnosis beyond current methods.

          <div>
            <h3>Advancing T1D Diagnosis with DNA</h3>
            <p>
              Participants will be asked to provide a saliva sample using a
              provided kit, which will be used for DNA analysis to develop the
              prediction model. This study has the potential to significantly
              improve early and accurate T1D detection, eliminating the
              misdiagnosis as T2D and providing the right treatments.

            <h4>What is Genomelink?</h4>
            <p>
              Every individual is made up of trillions of cells. Cells can be
              thought of as small, microscopic packets containing our DNA. DNA
              is necessary for the normal health and maintenance of our body. It
              is particularly important because it allows one’s genetic
              information, which influences health and physical characteristics,
              to be passed down from one generation to the next.
            </p>
            <p>
              Genes are segments of coding and non-coding DNA that provide
              instructions for the formation of proteins and other important
              biological compounds. Changes found in an individual’s genes or
              DNA (as compared to a normal, healthy individual) can cause
              disease or increase one’s risk for disease. Conversely, gene
              changes may also be protective against certain illnesses and
              diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
              We created Genomelink to give you insights about your DNA. We want
              to empower you by giving you information about how your DNA shapes
              your nutrition, fitness, personality and intelligence Traits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Genomelink provides Trait analysis for healthy individuals.
              Genomelink is not a diagnostic test and should not be used to
              diagnose any disease in yourself or others, is not appropriate for
              use the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, and
              is not intended for the assessment of a health condition. If you
              have concerns about a disease or medical condition, you should
              discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider.
            </p>
            <h4>How does Genomelink work?</h4>
            <p>
              To use Genomelink, you must first create a Genomelink account and
              then upload your Raw Data. The Raw Data you upload should come
              from one of the following Third Party DNA Services: 23andMe, My
              Heritage, or Ancestry.com. We may expand the list of Third Party
              DNA Services in the future. Before uploading your Raw Data, or the
              Raw Data about another person, and by signing this Informed
              Consent, you confirm that you have the rights and permissions
              necessary to share that Raw Data with us for use and disclosure as
              described in this Informed Consent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once we receive your Raw Data, we and our scientists analyze it to
              identify variants in the sequencing that may indicate the presence
              of, or risk for, a variety of non-medical Traits, such as your
              cognitive ability, height, waist size, and muscular strength.
              Variations can occur in the coding and/or non-coding portions of
              your DNA. We look at both the coding and non-coding portions to
              better predict your Traits.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to uploading your Raw Data, you may also choose to
              provide us with certain other Self-Reported Information that will
              help us improve your analysis and reports. First, you may complete
              a questionnaire that will ask you questions about your health,
              family tree, behaviors, and lifestyle. In addition, you may
              provide us with certain electronic health record data. Completing
              a questionnaire and providing this other Self-Reported information
              is completely voluntary.
            </p>
            <p>
              The information we gather from your Raw Data and your
              Self-Reported Information helps us to create individualized Trait
              information and reports that you can view and download through
              your Genomelink account.
            </p>
            <h4>What kind of Traits can I learn about?</h4>
            <p>
              The Trait analysis reports that we create for and about you will
              provide interpretation of your genes. Through our research and
              insights, we can give you different information about your Traits,
              including your preferences, characteristics, psychological trends,
              preferences, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence,
              abilities, and aptitudes. The number and types of reports you get
              will depend on whether you are a free or a paid user.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Traits we are able to analyze may change as we grow and
              enhance our research. The research and science behind Genomelink
              is based on the current state of knowledge about the field of
              genomics. Over time, we may learn more about DNA and how it
              affects various Traits. As this knowledge improves, we may (at our
              sole discretion) choose to update our research, reports, and the
              Genomelink service we provide you. As a result, your Trait
              analysis may change over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Genomelink does not currently analyze or report on medical
              diseases or medical-related traits. Therefore, genomic variants
              that might predict disease or carrier status (such as whether you
              are a carrier for Tay-Sachs disease or cystic fibrosis) will not
              be analyzed by us or identified in the Genomelink report.
            </p>
            <h4>Who will be able to access my results?</h4>
            <p>
              You, and any individual who you give access to your Genomelink
              account, will be able to access your Trait analysis and reports.

            <p>There are some risks to using the Genomelink Service.</p>
            <p>
              There is a chance that you could learn something about yourself
              that you did not want to know. For example, you may learn that you
              are predisposed to sadness, anger, or loneliness, or that you are
              likely to experience skin pigmentation or baldness. Since you
              share DNA with your blood relatives, what you learn about yourself
              could also affect them. You may want to discuss your options with
              a doctor, mental health professional or genetic counselor before
              or after you get your results.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a risk that your genetic information could be used as a
              basis of discrimination. To address concerns regarding possible
              health insurance and employment discrimination, many countries
              (including the United States) have enacted laws to prohibit
              genetic discrimination in those circumstances. The laws may not
              protect against genetic discrimination in other circumstances such
              as when applying for life insurance, disability insurance, or
              long-term care insurance. You should talk to your physician or
              genetic counselor if you have concerns about genetic
              discrimination.

            <p>
              We may need to share details about you with regulators and law
              enforcement. These details may include your Raw Data, Trait
              analysis, or other Personal Information. We will only share these
              details if we believe that the law or legal process requires us to
              do so. Please see our <a href="/">Privacy Policy</a> for more
              details.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, there is a risk that we experience a security incident
              and, as a result, someone accesses your data and results without
              authorization. This information could allow someone to connect
              your Raw Data and other Personal Information back to you. We take
              steps to reduce the risk of security incidents. Please see our
              Privacy Statement for more details.

            <h4>What are the limitations?</h4>
            <p>
              Genomelink has some limitations. Some of these limitations are
              unique to Genomelink, while other limitations are related to Trait
              analysis in general. Many of these limitations are discussed in
              our <a href="/">Terms of Use</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your Raw Data and Trait analysis cannot tell you everything about
              you -- your DNA is only a part of who you are. The analysis we do
              on your Raw Data, including any reports we create for you, is not
              deterministic. In other words, the analysis and results describe
              your probability of having a given Trait, and can only rarely
              predict when you have that Trait for certain. In some cases, the
              choices you make about how you live your life will influence your
              Traits more than your DNA.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is possible that the Raw Data you upload to Genomelink contains
              errors. In some cases, errors can occur when a Third Party DNA
              Service sequences your DNA or reads the stored genetic
              information. Because we do not, at this time, collect and test
              your DNA samples ourselves, we are unable to identify the errors
              that might occur in the processing of your DNA sample.
            </p>
            <h4>How do I withdraw my consent?</h4>
            <p>
              You can withdraw your consent at any time by stopping your use of
              Genomelink. You can also choose to close your Genomelink account.
              More details about closing your account and withdrawing your
              consent can be found in our Privacy Statement and Terms of Use. If
              you close your Genomelink account, you will not be able to access
              your information on Genomelink moving forward. When you close your
              account, we will archive your information. We will keep it
              archived for as long as we need to meet our legal and regulatory
              requirements. If you withdraw your consent, we discontinue the use
              of your data going forward. Withdrawing your consent does not
              affect or nullify how we used your data in the past.
            </p>
            <h4>Additional important information</h4>
            <p>
              We are not medical or healthcare professionals. We do not provide
              medical advice, medical diagnosis, or recommendations for medical
              treatment. We also do not provide genetic analysis or reports
              regarding diseases or medical conditions. If you need advice
              regarding diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of any disease,
              health, or medical condition, you should consult your doctor or
              another qualified healthcare professional.
